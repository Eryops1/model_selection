# Model selection
R Scripts and Markdown for model selection

## What is this about
A model connects the duration of amphibian species in the fossil record with certain ecological and morphological traits. To find the right model I try several approaches such as LM, [GAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model) and [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest). 

## Data
The data is a matrix containing species names and several variables. All species are extinct and data was collected from literature and [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/) and [the database of Vertebrates:fossil Fishes, Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds - fosFARbase](http://www.wahre-staerke.com/) The dataset has incomplete cases as well as some highly skewed variables. Due to the nature of the data, I try several modelling techniques.  
*Disclaimer: This is not the real data set that is used for publishing later on, but a test dataset that closely resembles the real datas characteristics.*

# Code
Modelling is done in R. Code is provided as R Markdown file. The script including output and some discussion can be found on [project webpage](https://eryops1.github.io/index.html) .
